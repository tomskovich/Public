# PUBLIC 

This is my repo for useful PowerShell/Python stuff. 
Mainly used/created for daily SysAdmin tasks while working at an MSP, or for private use.

More information will be posted on my [blog](https://tech-tom.com).

# POWERSHELL

## Functions

- [New-Password](https://github.com/tomskovich/Public/tree/main/PowerShell/blob/main/Functions/New-Password.ps1) 
    - Generates one or more "random" human-readable passwords, with some options for complexity and language. See [blog post](https://tech-tom.com/posts/powershell-password-generator/) for more information.

## Modules

- [OpenProvider](https://github.com/tomskovich/Public/tree/main/PowerShell/Modules/OpenProvider)
    - PowerShell wrapper around the OpenProvider API
    - Also includes a function to duplicate DNS zones from OpenProvider to Azure. (Sync-OPDnsToAzure)
        - I wrote this because we were having recurring issues with OpenProvider that forced us to move several DNS zones to Azure.
